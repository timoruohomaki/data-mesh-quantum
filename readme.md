# Data Mesh Quantum

### Ok, so what is this?

While the Data Mesh and data product obviously follows the concept defined by Zhamak Dehghani in her book Data Mesh and blog posts [1] and [2], some of the topics trace back to the earlier work of Neal Ford (Building Evolutionary Architectures) and Eric Evans (Domain-Driven Design).

The following definitions might be useful:

**Data Mesh**
Data Mesh can be defined by its four principles:
1. Domain-oriented ownership
2. Data as a product
3. Self-serve data platform
4. Federated computational governance

**Data Product**
Data as a product has the following characteristics:
+ _Discoverable_
+ _Addressable_
+ _Understandable_
+ _Trustworthy and truthful_
+ _Natively accessible_
+ _Interoperable and composable_
+ _Valuable on its own_
+ _Secure_

As defined by Dehghani: _A data product provides a set of explicitly defined and easy to use data sharing contracts. Each data product is autonomous and its life cycle and model are managed independently of others._

**Data Quantum/Quanta**


**Domain**
_A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity._

**Fitness Function**
_An architectural fitness function provides an objective integrity assessment of some architectural characteristic(s)._

### Initial Plan

The following diagram illustrates the basic concept of Data Quantum.
