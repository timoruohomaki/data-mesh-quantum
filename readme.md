## Data Mesh Quantum

#### Ok, so what is this?

While the Data Mesh and data product obviously follows the concept defined by Zhamak Dehghani in her book Data Mesh and blog posts [1] and [2], some of the topics trace back to the earlier work of Neal Ford (Building Evolutionary Architectures) and Eric Evans (Domain-Driven Design).

The following definitions might be useful:

**Data Mesh**

**Data Product**

**Data Quantum/Quanta**

**Fitness Function**

**Domain**
